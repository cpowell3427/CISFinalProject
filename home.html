	<p>Hi everyone!! I am sure I can skip the name since it is at the top of the page, so I am from Everett, WA, but I grew up for most of my childhood in Lake Chelan. 
I have one sibling, a younger sister by 5 years, Michelle. I am a little bit Japanese, 25% and the rest white. I listen to rap music and wanted to have a grill like Nelly when I was younger. My favorite memory growing up was all the family vacations we took,
DisneyWorld, Mexico, random camping trips, on the boat in the summers. Funny how growing up I didn't realize things were as good as they were.
Lots of Memories that make smile today. <br/></blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<p>I am loud, dauntless, mildly impulsive, and funny. I love to joke around and play pranks, really a big kid at heart. Which works out well with 3 children under 3 in my home. I am a single mother
	to four children, Natalie, 13, Keondre, 3, Kaylaunie, 18 months,
and Kaedrian, 5 months. I would never of thought I would have as many children or be so many so close together. At least, they will experience a better sibling bond than Michelle and I did because of our age difference.
Your probably wondering how does a single mother with a small football team go to school and make it work, me too. But here I am, it has taken me a little longer than I would have wanted but it is happening and progress is being made. But that is another story.<br/></blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<p>I took a vocational trade for Interactive Media in 2012 at Tacoma Community College. I fell in love with developing websites. I learned quite a bit that has given me a good foundation to feel very comfortable with these classes I am taking and 
the ones coming up. I really like HTML3 I think it was at the time and the different Adobe products. When I received my certificate for the trade, I knew I had to further my education to be able to have the job I wanted, obviously, Web Development. I didn't know 
exactly where I wanted to go inthis field and it took me a while to find the right fit. I am working towards my ATA in Web Development and Cloud Application. I know this is not going to feel like work in the long run because I love to do it. I love Edmonds 
Community College and am happy to be finishing my degree here vs Cascadia where I was going. Edmonds is just the right fit and I am grateful for that.
