<h1 style="text-align:center;">My AHA Moment!!</h1>

<p>I know the areas I need to work on and that is my testing ability. I really struggle with test anxiety and it gets the better of me a lot of the time, so moving forward I will incorporate new strategies to get beter
test scores. This was not my AHA moment because this is an ongoing struggle for me. The important part is I know the steps I need to take and find the resources available to help me be successful.</p>
<p>I have really enjoyed this class since the start and so I think I have had quite a few aha moments. I am thankful though, for the 
bit of HTML I have under my belt from my vocational trade, otherwise I may have been completely lost. The one part of this project I put off was the resume built with tables, being a visual learner I could not see
in my head how this was suppose to look and all the portfolio projects I seen on the websites from Mr. Ho did not have resumes built in tables so I was very nervous about this portion of the 
project. Then finally I just had to roll my sleeves up and get this thing done. I am very happy with the outcome of it and happy I am done with this class and prepared to move onto the next
course that will help me move towards the end goal I am working towards. </p>
